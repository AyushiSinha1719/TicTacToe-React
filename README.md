# TicTacToe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. It features a classic 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking their positions with either an "X" or "O". The game checks for a winner after every turn, identifying if a player has aligned three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. A unique feature of the game is its time travel functionality, which allows players to go back and view previous moves, demonstrating how Reactâ€™s state and history management can be applied in interactive applications. This project is a great way to learn the core concepts of React, including component-based architecture, state management, and event handling, while building a fun and interactive game.
